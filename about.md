Hey! I'm Alisa Kunimoto — a bioengineering student with a mechanical twist.

I’ve worked on everything from 3D-printed devices to coding simulations, and I’m always exploring how engineering can improve world health and advance technology. I'm also an experienced figure skater and flute player, and I take pride in bringing that same energy and discipline to my technical work. 

I also enjoy learning about intellectual property and read patents on my free time! I love listening to engineers and scientists when they explain how they solved a niche problem with a creative solution.

🇯🇵 日本語もオッケーです！ Looking for a someone fluent in Japanese ? 

🧠 Fun Fact: It’s canon lore about me that I worshipped QR codes during my Freshman year of college!

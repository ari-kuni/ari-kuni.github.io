# 💁‍♀️ About Me

Hey! I'm Alisa Kunimoto — a bioengineering student with a mechanical twist.

I’ve worked on everything from 3D-printed devices to coding simulations, and I’m always exploring how engineering can improve human health. I'm also an experienced figure skating coach and bring that same energy and discipline to my technical work.

🧠 Fun Fact: I love blending storytelling with STEM — whether through presentations, essays, or this site!

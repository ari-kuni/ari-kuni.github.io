Hey! I'm Alisa Kunimoto — a bioengineering student with a mechanical twist.

I’ve worked on everything from 3D-printed devices to coding simulations, and I’m always exploring how engineering can improve world health and advance technology. I'm also an experienced figure skater and flute player, and I take pride in bringing that same energy and discipline to my technical work. 

I also enjoy learning about intellectual property and read patents on my free time! I love listening to engineers and scientists when they explain how they solved a niche problem with a creative solution.

🇯🇵 日本語もオッケーです！ Looking for a someone fluent in Japanese ? 

🧠 Fun Fact: It’s canon lore about me that I worshipped QR codes during my Freshman year of college!

# Hobbies

## ⛸️ Ice Skating

I've competed in several national competitions including 21' and 22' Synchronized Skating National Championships and 23' National Showcase. I also qulified to be apart of the 23-24 Team USA at the Junior level. I have certifications from the U.S. Figure Skating Association including Platinum Award for competition and test performance. 

The descipline I recieved from the sport and the competition at high performance levels is a foundation to my life philosphy and provides me with confidence to always grow.

## 🪈 Flute 

I've competed in local flute competitions and participated in orchestra & marching band. I recieved State Honors in The California Music Teachers Association Level Advanced Examination for flute. While I enjoy playing a bit of classical, I also enjoy playing anime or video game music for fun.

# Japan 

## Minato Japanese School

After I moved from Japan to the United States, I continued my Japanese education at Minato Japanese School. There, I learned Japanese literature, mathematics, science, social studies, history, and culture. I attended Minato for 9 years, becoming fluent in Japanese and well-versed in Japanese Culture.

I also organized a summer program for 3rd graders to improve their math skills during COVID-19 when students were struggling to learn their multiplications times tables. As a student who thrived from meeting excellent teachers that allowed me to become curious about STEM, I want to provide opportunities to the next generation like my mentors.

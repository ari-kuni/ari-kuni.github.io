# About Me!
*I'm an bioengineering student with a passion for biology, mechanical systems, and coding. I enjoy blending creativity with problem-solving—whether it’s building something in a makerspace, diving into a coding project, or writing clear, impactful documents. Always curious and always learning, I love tackling challenges that sit at the intersection of science, tech, and human impact.*

### My Hobbies
*Beyond the classroom, I love expressing myself through music and ice skating. I’ve been playing the flute for years—and I find balance (literally) on the ice as a recreational figure skater. Whether I’m designing, programming, skating, or playing music, I’m always looking for creative ways to grow, connect, and have fun along the way.*

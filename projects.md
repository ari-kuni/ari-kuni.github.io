# 🛠️ Projects

Here are a few things I’ve been working on lately!

## Figure Skating Jump Landing Forces Analysis 
- Repetitive exposure to high ground reaction forces (GRFs) during figure skating jump training is associated with overuse injuries such as ankle sprains, stress fractures, and chronic tendinopathy. This article investigates the landing impact forces in figure skating jumps and how repeated loading leads to cumulative stress at the ankle. 
- The biomechanics analysis focuses on two main questions. The first is how large are the vertical GRFs during landing? The second is how the landing technique influences these forces. To address these questions, the analysis applies Newton’s second law and the impulse momentum theorem to estimate the average vertical GRF over the deceleration time based on the change in vertical momentum over the landing time. Inverse dynamics of the lower limb are used to estimate joint reaction forces and moments at the ankle, and energy balance concepts are used to describe how eccentric muscle contractions and material compliance affect energy absorption.
- Incorperate proposition of a biomechanically designed insole inserted into the skate boot that increases energy absorption, extends the deceleration period, and redistributes plantar loads to lower the risk of overuse injuries while maintaining practice performance.
- Greatly references data from this Github respository. [ryota-skating/FS-Jump3D](https://github.com/ryota-skating/FS-Jump3D?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Many thanks to them for collecting all of this vital data.

## 𖠣 Snake Vertebrae Mechanism Arm
- Designed a biomimetic robotic arm inspired by snake vertebrae to grab, transport, and place objects.
- Implemented a geared rotation system and drive chain for expanded degrees of freedom.
- Design, fabricate, and analyze the different components of the robot and participate in a competition to determine the best robot.
- Utalize skills in hand sketching, CAD (AutoCAD & Fusion360), rapid prototyping, laser cutting, basic shop tools (drilling, tapping, reaming, press fits), machine design fundamentals (bearings, gear ratios, power transmission), and applying physics to analysis of machine design.
